Some very basic structure to get started with the game.

Squash (Solitaire) :

Elements: a Ball and a Paddle

Ball: once inserted to the playground, it moves (on its own/animation) to a certain set of rules.

Rule1: Ball bounces (changes its direction) when it hits the left, right or upper bound of the playground.

Rule2: Ball bounces when it hits the paddle.

Rule3: Ball leaves the playground when it "hits" lower bound of the playground.

Rule4: A new Ball is inserted when the previous Ball has left the playground (your choice if that happens automatically or on some sort of user interaction).


Paddle: is moved by user interaction. Keyboard or Mouse

Deluxe: Add whichever additional element you like (these are just examples)

a BallDepot, containing a limited amount of Balls. Game Over when empty.
